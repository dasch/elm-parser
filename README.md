# dasch/parser

Parser combinators for Elm.

This library does not attempt to provide the fastest parsing API, nor does it allow for the most flexibility when it comes to error messages and contextual feedback. Rather, this library seeks to provide an intuitive, easy to use API for writing parsers that don't need to be crazy fast or provide detailed error messages.
